Major things
------------

PacketHandler has no access to server information, and since it's a layered API, it shouldn't. 
This means that I cannot place server code in PacketHander.cpp. Instead, I, as the caller, need
to be able to set the callbacks.

PacketHandler callbacks don't need to all have the same signature, you can have a bound function for
each type and set them on an individual basis. This would be more convenient.

Need a way to set the port on an existing socket instead of creating a new one for each user and non
user sent packet. Alternatively have the Send function accept a port as a parameter. This is necessary
because I need to collect user ports, and you're forced to bind it by creating a new socket which can't
happen as the client is already bound to it.

SocketWrapper takes an IP in the constructor, and then you have to give it another IP every time you
want to send something.

Not as Major things
-------------------

CheckForWaitingData() calls Retrieve(), but the name doesn't imply that it should.
